                            <p>My name is Isaac Smith. I'm a 24 year old software developer based out of Virginia. I graduated from Grand Valley State University with a degree in Computer Science in May 2017.</p>

                                Along with being a full time software developer I like spending a lot of my free time doing outdoor activities with my fiancee. We moved from Grand Rapids MI to Lynchburg VA in the fall of 2018 so she could pursue medical school.
                                In our short time in Virginia we have been doing our best to explore as many local hiking trails, lakes, and restaurants as we can.

                        <p>
                            My responsibilties at Steel Dynamics range from day to day. I work as a Database Administrator, Developer, and as IT support. I've been tasked with updating our internal hub to better support our mill workers. This has included allowing mill workers to track and log data
                            in our systems so we have better backups and visibility into our day to day production info as well as beginning the process of updating our internal hub to a MVC solution. I've also been involved with integrating our systems into SalesForce, this has required
                            transferring data from our Progress system over to SQL to then be pulled into SalesForce. I've been trained as a SalesForce administrator and have experience using Dell Boomi for data transfer and scheduling job processes. On top of my normal day to day tasks
                            I have been working with our management team to update our internal process maps, issue workflow, source control management, and upgrading system security. Being involved with management in shaping how IT will perform and handle future tasks and approvals has 
                            allowed me to help shift our IT department in a more modern direction with proper use of source control and issue approvals.

                            During my time on the Atmosphere Sky Mobile Application team I performed cross platform agile development utilizing C# asp.net and Xamarin Studio. It was my job to work with our Technical Architect, Designers, Product Owner, Stakeholders, and both internal and external teams
                            to create and implement new features into our mobile app to maximize our users experience. Along with developing new features I was tasked with fixing bugs and developing more robust unit testing. During my time at Amway I was able to increase product registration
                            by 40% by implementing one-touch registration into our application.

                            I feel very fortunate to have been able to attend GVSU. Their Computer Science program allowed me to continuously learn and grow as a developer as well as meet long lasting friends and contacts during the process. I was able to work on many different projects
                            both independently and in group settings. The GVSU CIS program was a close knit community where we were all able to help each other learn and grow. I believe having this close knit experience helped me become a better teammate and enhanced my ability to help and learn
                            from others. If I had to name only one thing as a take away from my undergrad experience - is that you can learn something from everyone and exploring new ideas and concepts can only help you grow as a person and professional.

                            While pursuing a degree in Computer Science I interned on Amway's ATLAS Application Administration team. I was in charge of creating reporting sites for our applications to display back-end server and job information to monitor our systems.
                            In addition to software monitoring I was able to create Jira workflows to handle our incident and patch approval process for better tracking and insight on work being done on our team.
